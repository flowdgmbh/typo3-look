What does it do?
================

The TYPO3 page module normally shows a content element as a plain summary: a
headline, the first lines of text, maybe a thumbnail. Editors have to open the
frontend to see what they actually built.

Look changes that. It renders every content element with the **real frontend
templates, stylesheets and images of your website** and shows the result
directly in the page module, scaled down to fit. What you see in the backend
is what visitors get on the website.

    :class: with-shadow

    Content elements in the page module, rendered with the frontend design of
    the site.

Each preview lives in its own **isolated frame**. It looks like the frontend
but cannot interact with the backend: no clicks, no scripts of the page
content, no access to the editor's session. The frame adapts its height to
the content automatically, so short and tall elements both look natural.

    :class: with-shadow

    A text and media element as editors see it: the frontend layout with
    headline, copy and image.

..  _for-whom:

Who is it for?
==============

*   **Editors** see the effect of every setting immediately: a different
    header layout, a coloured section, an image position. No more switching
    between backend and frontend. With the edit overlay enabled, a click on
    the preview opens the element for editing.

*   **Integrators** reuse the frontend templates they already have. A preview
    is one Fluid tag around the existing rendering, there is no second
    template to keep in sync.

*   **Administrators** get previews that are safe by default. Scripts and
    media of the website are switched off inside the preview until they are
    explicitly allowed, see :ref:`security`.

..  _how-it-works:

How does it work?
=================

Look ships one Fluid view helper, :html:`<look:backend.contentPreview>`. You
wrap it around the frontend markup of a content element, typically in the
backend preview template of a Content Block. The view helper

#.  renders the markup you pass it,
#.  puts it into a complete HTML document together with the stylesheets and
    scripts of your site,
#.  and shows that document in a sandboxed :html:`<iframe>` in the page module.

The frame reports its content height to the backend, so the page module
always shows the whole element (or a fixed height with a fade-out, if you
prefer). Everything else, from the design to the icons, comes from your own
frontend build.
