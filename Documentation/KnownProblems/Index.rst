===============================
Known problems and how to solve
===============================

Most problems come from the isolation of the preview frame. The frame has an
*opaque origin*, which changes how browsers treat a few frontend techniques.
This chapter lists the symptoms and the fixes.

..  _known-problems-external-hosts:

Assets from other hosts do not load
===================================

**Symptom:** web fonts from Google Fonts, a library from a CDN or images from
an external server are missing in the preview, while they work on the
website. The console reports a Content Security Policy violation, not a
CORS error.

**Cause:** the preview document inherits the Content Security Policy of the
TYPO3 backend, which by default only allows assets from the backend's own
host. Adding a CORS header does not help here, the browser refuses the
request before it is sent.

**Fix:** serve the assets from your own host, or extend the backend policy
for the hosts you trust with a :file:`Configuration/ContentSecurityPolicies.php`
in your site package:

..  code-block:: php
    :caption: EXT:my_site/Configuration/ContentSecurityPolicies.php

    <?php

    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\Directive;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\Mutation;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\MutationCollection;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\MutationMode;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\Scope;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Security\ContentSecurityPolicy\UriValue;
    use TYPO3\CMS\Core\Type\Map;

    return Map::fromEntries([
        Scope::backend(),
        new MutationCollection(
            new Mutation(MutationMode::Extend, Directive::FontSrc, new UriValue('https://fonts.gstatic.com')),
            new Mutation(MutationMode::Extend, Directive::StyleSrc, new UriValue('https://fonts.googleapis.com')),
        ),
    ]);

See the `Content Security Policy chapter <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/main/en-us/ApiOverview/ContentSecurityPolicy/Index.html>`__
of the core API reference for the details.

..  _known-problems-fonts:

Fonts or scripts do not load
============================

**Symptom:** the preview uses fallback fonts, or with
:confval:`allowSiteScripts <flag-allow-site-scripts>` the site scripts do not
run. The browser console inside the frame reports a CORS error.

**Cause:** web fonts and JavaScript modules are loaded as cross-origin
requests from the frame. The web server does not send
:code:`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for them. Look's own script is not
affected, it is a classic script.

**Fix:** add the header for the path your frontend build lives in, see
:ref:`installation-webserver`.

..  _known-problems-icons:

SVG icons are missing
=====================

**Symptom:** icons referenced as an external SVG sprite are blank. The console
says "Unsafe attempt to load URL ... from frame with URL about:srcdoc".

**Cause:** :html:`<svg><use href="/icons.svg#play">` may only load files from
the same origin, and the frame has none.

**Fix:** inline the SVG when rendering for the preview. A small view helper
that reads the icon file and returns its markup does the job. Detect the
preview context in your templates, for example with a flag your preview
template sets, and switch between the sprite reference (frontend) and the
inline markup (preview):

..  code-block:: html

    <f:if condition="{isBackendPreview}">
        <f:then>{my:svg.inline(path: 'EXT:my_site/Resources/Public/Icons/{name}.svg', class: 'icon')}</f:then>
        <f:else>
            <svg class="icon"><use href="{f:uri.resource(path: 'EXT:my_site/Resources/Public/Icons/{name}.svg')}#icon"></use></svg>
        </f:else>
    </f:if>

Icons that are inlined in the frontend anyway need no change.

..  _known-problems-three-times:

The preview appears three times
===============================

**Symptom:** with Content Blocks, the whole preview is repeated three times.

**Cause:** Content Blocks renders :file:`backend-preview.html` for the header,
the content and the footer of the element.

**Fix:** use the :html:`Preview` layout with a :html:`Content` section, see
:ref:`usage-content-blocks`.

..  _known-problems-images:

Images are missing, "File ... does not exist"
=============================================

**Symptom:** the preview shows broken images or an error about a processed
file that does not exist.

**Cause:** backend requests defer image processing to a later request. A
frontend template that expects the processed file immediately (for example a
custom picture renderer) does not get it.

**Fix:** set the :php:`fileProcessing` aspect of the TYPO3 context to
non-deferred (:php:`new FileProcessingAspect(false)`) while rendering the
preview, in the same wrapper that handles the visibility aspect.

..  _known-problems-red-callout:

A red callout instead of the preview
====================================

**Symptom:** the page module shows "Preview could not be rendered" with an
error message and a code.

**Cause:** rendering the frontend markup threw an exception.

**Fix:** in development context (or with backend debugging enabled) the
callout names the problem, usually a missing partial, a wrong argument or a
PHP error in a view helper; in production it shows only the error code and
the details go to the TYPO3 log. Correct the template and reload the page
module.

..  _known-problems-install-tool:

Nothing works in the standalone Install Tool
============================================

The previews need the nonce of a backend request. The standalone Install Tool
(:file:`/typo3/install.php`) has none and does not render page module
previews, which is expected.
